/**
 * @assertion If a class [C] in an opted-in library implements the same
 * generic class [I] more than once as [I0], .., [In], and at least one of the
 * [Ii] is not syntactically equal to the others, then it is an error if
 * [NNBD_TOP_MERGE(S0, ..., Sn)] is not defined where [Si] is [NORM(Ii)].
 * Otherwise, for the purposes of runtime subtyping checks, [C] is considered to
 * implement the canonical interface given by [NNBD_TOP_MERGE(S0, ..., Sn)].
 *
 * If a class [C] in an opted-in library overrides a member, it is an error if
 * its signature is not a subtype of the types of all overriden members from all
 * super-interfaces (whether legacy or opted-in). For the purposes of override
 * checking, members which are inherited from opted-in classes through legacy
 * classes are still checked against each original declaration at its opted-in
 * type. For example, the following override is considered an error.
 *
 *  // opted_in.dart
 *  class A {
 *      int foo(int? x) {}
 *  }
 *  // opted_out.dart
 *  // @dart = 2.6
 *  import 'opted_in.dart';
 *
 * class B extends A {}
 *  // opted_in.dart
 *  class C extends B {
 *  // Override checking is done against the opted-in signature of A.foo
 *  int? foo(int x) {}
 *  }
 *
 * @description  Check that if legacy class inherits a setter from two opted in
 * classes with contradictory nullability information and than this setter is
 * inherited again in the opted in code, compile error appears.
