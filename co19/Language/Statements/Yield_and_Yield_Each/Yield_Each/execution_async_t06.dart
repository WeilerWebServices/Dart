/**
 * @assertion If m is marked async*, then:
 *    • It is a dynamic error if the class of o does not implement Stream.
 *  Otherwise
 *    • For each element x of o:
 *    – If the stream u associated with m has been paused, then execution
 * of m is suspended until u is resumed or canceled.
 *    – If the stream u associated with m has been canceled, then let c be
 * the finally clause of the innermost enclosing try-finally statement, if any.
 * If c is defined, let h be the handler induced by c. If h is defined,
 * control is transferred to h. If h is undefined, the immediately enclosing
 * function terminates.
 *    – Otherwise, x is added to the stream associated with m in the order
 * it appears in o. The function m may suspend.
 *    • If the stream o is done, execution of s is complete.
 *
 * @description Check that if the stream u associated with m has been paused,
 * then execution of m is suspended until u is cancelled. Using Completer to
 * control generator execution before yield* statement. Stream u is cancelled
 * before yield* is executed.
