 * @assertion Evaluation of an identifier expression e of the form id proceeds

 * Let d be the innermost declaration in the enclosing lexical scope whose name

 * the declaration of the inherited member named id if it exists.
 * ...
 * â€¢ If d is the declaration of a library variable, top-level getter or
 *   top-level setter, then e is equivalent to the getter invocation id.
 * @description  Checks that if evaluation of the initializer expression of a
