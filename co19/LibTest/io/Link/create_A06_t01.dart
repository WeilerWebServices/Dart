/**
 * @assertion Future<Link> create(
 *  String target, {
 *  bool recursive: false
 *  })
 * Creates a symbolic link. Returns a Future<Link> that completes with the link
 * when it has been created. If the link exists, the future will complete with
 * an error.
 *
 * If recursive is false, the default, the link is created only if all
 * directories in its path exist. If recursive is true, all non-existing path
 * components are created. The directories in the path of target are not
 * affected, unless they are also in path.
 *
 * On the Windows platform, this will only work with directories, and the target
 * directory must exist. The link will be created as a Junction. Only absolute
 * links will be created, and relative paths to the target will be converted to
 * absolute paths by joining them with the path of the directory the link is
 * contained in.
 *
 * On other platforms, the posix symlink() call is used to make a symbolic link
 * containing the string target. If target is a relative path, it will be
 * interpreted relative to the directory containing the link.
 * @description Checks that on non-Windows platforms only absolute links will be
 * created, and relative paths to the target will be interpreted relative to the
 * directory containing the link.
