/**
 * @assertion void createSync(
 *  String target, {
 *  bool recursive: false
 *  })
 *  Synchronously create the link. Calling createSync on an existing link will
 *  throw an exception.
 *
 *  If recursive is false, the default, the link is created only if all
 *  directories in its path exist. If recursive is true, all non-existing path
 *  components are created. The directories in the path of target are not
 *  affected, unless they are also in path.
 *
 *  On the Windows platform, this will only work with directories, and the
 *  target directory must exist. The link will be created as a Junction. Only
 *  absolute links will be created, and relative paths to the target will be
 *  converted to absolute paths.
 *
 *  On other platforms, the posix symlink() call is used to make a symbolic link
 *  containing the string target. If target is a relative path, it will be
 *  interpreted relative to the directory containing the link.
 * @description Checks that this method creates the link
