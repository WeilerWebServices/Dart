/**
 * @assertion Future<Isolate> spawn(void entryPoint(message), message,
 * {bool paused: false, bool errorsAreFatal, SendPort onExit, SendPort onError})
 *
 *    The argument entryPoint specifies the entry point of the spawned isolate.
 * It must be a top-level function or a static method that takes one argument -
 * that is, one-parameter functions that can be compile-time constant function
 * values. It is not allowed to pass the value of function expressions or
 * an instance method extracted from an object.
 *
 *    The entry-point function is invoked with the initial message. Usually
 * the initial message contains a SendPort so that the spawner and spawnee can
 * communicate with each other.
 *  ...
 *    Returns a future that will complete with an Isolate instance if
 * the spawning succeeded. It will complete with an error otherwise.
 *
 * @description Checks that if entryPoint is some string value, then type error
 * is arisen in checked mode or returned Future instance completes with error
 * otherwise
 * @compile-error
